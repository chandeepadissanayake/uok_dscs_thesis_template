\chapter{Methodology}

% Write the content of the methodology here. Here's a guideline for a flow that you could use.
%   1. Data description
%   2. Conceptual Map
%   3. Implementation Details
%   4. Validation and etc.

% Add any other required sub-sections here.
% Tip: If it seems useful, use the aforementioned flow as sub-sections.
% Do not fill the contents of the sub-sections here itself. Use a separate file created in
%   research/methodology
% Use the following format to add any such sub-sections:
%   \section{SUBSECTION TITLE GOES HERE}
%       \input{SUBSECTION FILE PATH GOES HERE}
%   \clearpage
