%         6
%            I) Tables:
%                 i. Use \table tag to define all tables. Borders must be visible and 1pt.
%                ii. Headers must be in bold face.
%               iii. Tables must be captioned and centered.
%                iv. Padding must be such that the borders donâ€™t touch the text in every cell.
%                 v. Text in each cell must be left-aligned (flushed left)
%           II) Figures:
%                 i. Use \figure tag to define all figures.
%                ii. Figures must be captioned.
%               iii. All figures must ONLY be uploaded to resources/figures folder.
%          III) References:
%                 i. All reference material that are used must be defined in 
%                    research/references.tex. This can be achieved in either of the following 
%                    methods.
%                ii. Defined as a list in references.tex using \bibitem. Refer to: 
%                    https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Bibliography_management_with_bibtex
%               iii. Defined in a .bib file, typically exported from a reference management 
%                    tool. Steps are as follows.
%                       a. Upload all .bib files into resources/references folder.
%                       b. Add all files as references into research/references.tex file using
%                          the tag: \bibliography{bib_file_name.bib}
%
% Important NOTE:  
%   Add any packages that you need to use in your compilation in settings/user_dependencies.tex
%
% Additional Notes:
%
%   I. Do NOT attempt to change the contents of portions of markup where it is explicitly
%      specified not to do so, unless you're assured about what you're doing.
%  II. Contents inside settings/global.tex is better left intact. Changing them would cause 
%      large and possibly catastrophic changes to the styles.
% III. Do not change any template dependencies in settings/template_dependencies.tex as well.
%  IV. It's better not to change the folder structure.
%   V. You can add any custom environments inside the folder envs but be cautious in doing so.
